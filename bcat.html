    <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>For our Master’s Capstone, we worked with Karen Perry of the National Telecommunication and Information Administration and Will Saunders from the State of Washington to redesign the Broadband Connectivity Assessment Tool (BCAT).</p>
        <p>The tool, which provides an online assessment to help communities assess their broadband and internet needs and plan for advocacy, had recently been beta tested in 15 communities throughout the United States.  Participants widely varied in their success with the tool.  Our task was to help discover why they got the results they did, and come up with a solution that would help make the next version better meet the needs of a wide variety of communities.</p>

 <div class="colorsection">
    <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
        <ul>How might we improve the BCAT to support a broader array of communities in assessing their local broadband needs?</ul>
    <h4>Project Goals</h4> 
        <ul>
            <li>Support wide variety of communities in the BCAT, including both rural and urban communities</li>
            <li>Provide in-depth user research on the beta of the BCAT</li>
            <li>ommunicate findings of research and translate insights into design recommendations</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>The Project</h3>
    <h4>Heuristic Evaluation</h4>
        <p>Since we were working on a redesign of an existing tool, we felt a good place to start would be a heuristic evaluation of the previous version.</p>
        <p>Due to privacy restrictions, our access to the previous version was limited to a demo and screenshots of the first version of the BCAT.  We did, however, have access to the content of the assessment itself.</p>
        <p>We began by completing a heuristic evaluation of the interface.  Because we were dealing with static screenshots and notes from the demo, this ended up being a bit limited, but it gave us a general idea of what were the failings of the current version
        </p>
        <p>We drew from Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics to help guide our evaluation.</p>
        <p>Major problems that were found included poor navigation, no indication of progress, and lack of feedback upon completion.

        </div>
    <h4>Value Sensitive Design</h4>
        <p>Value Sensitive Design (VSD) is a design methodology I was introduced to at the UW's iSchool, which aims to systematically account for human values in the design process.  Since broadband policy touches a lot of issues dealing with the digital divide, we felt that including parts of this methodology would help ensure that our design decisions would be cognizant of these values.</p>
        <p>We used two methods: <br>
        A conceptual investigation: <br>
            We named the key values in the design space and defined them.  These evolved as we talked with users, and included values such as fairness, inclusion, and engagement. 
        </p>
        <p>Direct and indirect stakeholder analysis:<br>
            We considered the needs and desires of those who would be directly using the tool, as well as those who would be effected even if not a direct user.  For example, a user of the BCAT might be a local librarian.  An indirect stakeholder might be a community member, a library patron, coworker, or family member.  While only one will interface with the tool, the technology touches all of their lives, and considering both types of stakeholders can help think about the holistic environment surrounding the use of the BCAT.
        </p>
        
   
   
        <h4>User Research</h4>
        <h5>Semi-Structured Interviews</h5>
        <p>As we prepared to talk with the participants of the beta version of the BCAT, we created a protocol for semi-structured interviews that would help us understand how they used the tool, what their goals were, what they thought worked well, and what didn’t.  </p>
        <p>Since we were contacting these users months after completing the beta, we understood our work to be more user research than a usability study.  We would not be able to get a lot of reliable feedback about specifics of using the tool (perhaps at best, a user might remember a few really irritating problems) so we focused on understanding how the holistic BCAT experience (team formation and dynamics, the assessment, the tool, etc.) was for the users, rather than the just the tool in particular.</p>
        <p>The semi-structured interview protocol allowed us to adapt our questions based on the direction of the conversation, participants’ interests and differences in experience (team leader vs. team member, urban vs. rural, successful vs. unsuccessful beta). We conducted ten interviews with eleven participants from seven of the fifteen communities that participated in the BCAT pilot project.  They were located in places like rural counties and the Seattle metro area in Washington state,  Kansas City, MO, Vinal Haven, ME, and Louisville, KY.  All interviews were done over the phone or via Zoom.</p>

        <h5>Affinity Diagramming</h5>
        <p>To analyze our results in a formalized way, we used affinity diagramming as a way to pull out major themes that had arose in the interviews.  </p>
        <div class="portfolioimage">
            <img src="Images/BCAT/Affinitydiagram.jpeg" alt="Affinity Diagram" >
        </div>
        <p>Some of the major themes that became apparent included:
            <ul id="leftlist">   
                <li>Limitations of Internet Connection</li>
                <li>Repetition in Assessment</li>
                <li>Issues of Community Representation/Inclusion</li>
                <li>Expertise for Analysis of BCAT Findings</li>
                <li>Length of Report Unusable</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h5>User Stories and Requirements Document</h5>
            <p>We translated our findings into a requirements document, which captured the elements that worked and should be included, as well as those that needed to be changed or added to.</p>
            <p>We put these requirements into user stories, separated into three categories, user (general), participant (BCAT team members), and administrator (BCAT team leader).</p>
            <p>An example of this is:<br>
                Theme: Trouble loading tool for users with poor connection to internet
                <br>Requirement: Link to download file to complete locally
                <br>User Story: As a user, I need to be able to download my portion of the assessment when I have a connection and complete offline
            </p>
            <div class="portfolioimage">
                 <img src="Images/BCAT/userstory.png" alt="Example User Story">
            </div>
    <h4>Design</h4>
        <h5>Background Research</h5>
            <p>We did research in two areas to better understand the design space: project management tools, and existing community-based frameworks for working in digital-inclusion and broadband.</p>
            <p>We looked at ways tools such as Asana and Basecamp approach managing different projects, messages, deadlines, assignments, etc. to understand how the BCAT might incorporate those elements to streamline the assessment process.</p>
            <p>We also looked at frameworks that attempt to solve similar problems, such as the American Library Association’s Libraries Transforming Communities and tools from the Intelligent Communities Forum.</p>
        <h5>The Holistic Experience</h5>
            <p>The BCAT experience went far beyond just the interface of the tool.  We considered the entire journey of our users, from the beginning of being introduced to broadband issues, to speaking to policy makers and advocating for their communities.</p>
            <p>To support this holistic approach, we included information on building and understanding broadband issues, support through cohorts of other BCAT communities, and resources for turning the findings into actionable results.</p>
            <p>Our research showed that a community’s success, not just in the assessment, but in broadband advocacy as a whole, was having a strong leader who would champion the work. </p>
            <p>As such, our redesign aimed to make the administrator’s work easier, and to enable them to use the BCAT as a springboard for community engagement. </p>
        <h5>Reorganizing the Assessment</h5>
            <p>Our research showed differences both between and within teams that led to certain groups only completing a particular portion of the assessment.  For example, a team in an urban community might have less of a need for information on broadband infrastructure, but more of a need for how to increase digital inclusion and adoption. Within a team, some participants might be more knowledgeable about the technical questions about broadband capacity (ex. A local ISP), where others might be more capable of answering questions about technology education opportunities in the community (ex. a librarian). </p>
            <p>To account for the variety of different needs, we split the assessment into two “pathways.” </p>
            <p>The first is “Adoption & Digital Inclusion,” which contains the less-technical, more human-focused side of broadband accessibility.  This is well suited for urban communities, which might be looking to help community members maximize the benefits of internet connectivity.</p>
            <p>The second is “Infrastructure and Availability,” which focuses on the technical and policy components of broadband in the community.  This pathway provides an understanding of which areas have what type of broadband connectivity, which is important for rural areas hoping to advocate for additional infrastructure funding. </p>
            <p>A community may either choose to the entire assessment, or either of the pathways based on their needs.  Individual participants may also be assigned to do either or both of the pathways, based on their availability or expertise. </p>

                <img src="Images/BCAT/organization.png" alt="Pathway Orgnization for Assessment">
            </div>  
        <h5>Content Editing</h5>
            <p>We found that many users complained of the length, inaccessibility of language, and repetitiveness of the assessment.  To improve this, we shortened the assessment, removed redundant questions, and grouped related questions to on one page, reducing the effort to complete each question.  The new pathways through the assessment also effectively shorten the assessment for each participant, by only showing them questions within their domain of expertise. </p>
            <p>Additionally, my partner reworked the language of the questions from a college reading level, to 9th to 12th grade reading levels (depending on subject matter). </p>
        <h5>Information Architecture</h5>
            <p>The information architecture of the new BCAT is centered around a user dashboard from which users can easily access the most common tasks.  Participants can view assignments and work on the assessment. Administrators can manage their teams and their assignments, manage deadlines and reminders, gather data, and view their team members’ responses. There is also a global nav consistent across all users.</p>

            </div>
        <h5>User Flows</h5>
            <p>I made user flows prior to beginning wireframing, so I would have a clear idea of what pages/steps I might include in the designs.  This was particularly important for the sign up flows, as they differ for participants vs. administrators, and for entry point (NTIA BroadbandUSA site vs. shared link via team leader). </p>
            <div class="portfolioimage">
                <img src="Images/BCAT/signupflow.png" alt="Navigation for Admin">
            </div>
        <h5>Wireframes</h5>
            <p>I first sketched ideas for wires with pen and paper. After discussing these ideas with my partner and the project owners, I made versions of both the participant and administrator wireframes, using the user flows to determine which screens were necessary. </p>
            <div class="portfolioimage">

            <!-- <img src="Images/BCAT/signupflow.png" alt="Navigation for Admin" height=auto; width=500px;> -->
            <p>The barebones wires were turned into higher fidelity, following the US Government’s U.S. Web Design System Style Guide.  These were then annotated explaining interactions and details for handoff to the project owners.  The project is currently awaiting being taken up by a local non-profit or receiving government funding, so we wanted to ensure that whenever or whoever picks up our work would be able to understand our design decisions and the research they were grounded in.</p>
