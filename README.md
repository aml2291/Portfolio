# Portfolio
This is portfolio v...6?  I first developed it for a beggining web dev class using just HTML/CSS, then re-coded it when I wasn't under such a tight class schedule. Then reworked it when I wanted to learn Bootstrap. Then got tired of having to code everything myself and started putting it together on Squarespace.  Then switched to Wix because I liked their editor better.  Finally, I wanted to have more control, and so after taking a more in-depth web dev class, here is Portfolio 6.0.
